Exa is a llm focus search engine which allows us to retrieve results from the web to provide additional context for our generation before giving you your results.

You have to create a `.env` file where you will store your openai_api_key and exa_api_key:
1. OPENAI_API_KEY ="Your_openai_key"
2. EXA_API_KEY = "Your_exa_key"
3. Exa API key: get it at dashboard.exa.ai
4. Openai API key: get it at OPENAI
